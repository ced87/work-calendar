# Add work duties to my Google calendar

This app adds my work duties and days off to my google calendar.
The data for my work duties and rotation are in a dictionary in duties.json file.

This is my first 'completed' Python app. I keep coming back to it to improve it and fix any bugs that come up as I used it to actually put work duties into my calendar.

The "credentials.json" file that I got from the Google Cloud Console is, obviously, not included.

Packages to download:
* google-api-python-client
* google-auth-httplib2
* google-auth-oauthlib
* datefinder
