# Add work duties to my Google calendar

This app adds my work duties and days off to my google calendar.
The info for my work duties are in a dictionary in the .pkl files.

This code probably needs a lot of cleaning up. This is my first 'completed' Python app.

The "client_secret.json" file that I got from the Google APIs site is removed.

Also, the packages:
* google-api-python-client
* google-auth-httplib2
* google-auth-oauthlib
* datefinder
